# Compare the timings found by our algorithm with the existing beat onset data

# search the first row of the corresponding csv file to find the right take (same name as the audio file)
# for each beat onset row in that column compare the time noted in the csv file with the time found by our algorithm
# compute the difference between these two values to find the accuracy of our algorithm?
# note any outliers in our data to identify places to improve
